                    <h2>My Journey So Far</h2>
                    <p>As a young boy, I always had passion for computers and most electronics. Whenever there was fault
                        with my parents mobile devices, the TV channel is not displaying or my mom change turn on the
                        torch, they always called me gradually, i found myself drawn towards computer and computer
                        science.</p>
                    <p>I joined the college last semster and we started with five major courses: Maths for Computer
                        Science, HTML CSS (one of my faveorite since it is also essential for my career), programming
                        fundamentals, Intro to nerworking and Essential communication skills.</p>
                    <p>I learned many things and i improved significantly in the following areas:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Communication skills</h4>
                            <p>Like ive mention, i am not a native english speaker and i was not always confident aboyr
                                =t my communication skills. During last semester, I learned the FACED technique and i
                                practiced speaking in public.
                                <br>Although, I dont have 100% in my communication skills, I know personally as an
                                individual, i am significantly better than i was before joining the college.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Dedication and commitment to studies</h4>
                            <p>My educational background wasnt always this solid and efficient. The academic system in
                                my country Nigeria is miles behind what i am experiencing now in the college and so the
                                environment is different. We have more Assignment, like, assignment after every major
                                lecture. That is really nice as it teaches me to be dedicated and commited to my studies
                                and life's activites as a whole.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Problem Solving skills</h4>
                            <p>One of the modules from last semester was Problem Solving. Yes, it was difficult
                                initially but thanks to my lecturers and the assignments, i now utilize the skills,
                                technique and everything from the module into almost all activites i do,</p>
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="col-sm-3">
                    <h3>Do you know?</h3>
                    <p>I am a NIgerian? Yes, I am not a native english speaker but i look forward to learning more.</p>

                    <p>During my free time, i watch lots of YouTube tutorials. They were my first exposure to
                        programming and i started learning from YouTube before i joined Mohawk</p>
