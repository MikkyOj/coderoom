                        <p>As a young boy, I always had passion for computers and most electronics. Whenever there was
                            fault with my parents mobile devices, the TV channel is not displaying or my mom change turn
                            on the torch, they always called me and gradually, i found myself drawn towards computer and
                            computer science. <br> To see more, <a href="page2.html">click here!!</a>.</p>

                        <h2>MY Dreams In MOHAWK</h2>
                        <p>Mohawk College is a very nice place to be in and it is a great priviledge to be amongst the
                            students of this prestigious college. I am a student in the Software development program and
                            i wish to have a solid career in computer science.</p>
                        <p>Coming into Mohawk College, I had my mind fixated on two things and two things only. Everyday
                            i attend classes, i remind myself of my purpose here. I also go through each day with
                            positivity that for as long as i am a student here, i can realize my dreams.</p>
                        <p>The first thing is to learn and improve myself than I was yesterday. This doesnt seem like
                            much but i really love to make improvemrnts and i check my progress with the little
                            acheivements i made the day before.
                            <br>Also, the second thing that pushes me as a student here in Mohawk also as an individual
                            is to become a Full Stack Deveoper and have a great career in the industry, I want to build
                            awesome applications like MyMohawkApp and even greater websites than MyCanvas. Cliche? I am
                            only human and i have these dreams
                        </p>

                        <p>During my free time, i watch lots of YouTube tutorials. They were my first exposure to
                            programming and i started learning from YouTube before i joined Mohawk</p>
